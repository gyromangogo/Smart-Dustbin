# Smart-Dustbin
This is a code for smart dustbin that uses ultrasonic sensors to check if the dustbin is filled or not and sends the information to the system. 
It is my first project as an Engineering student. You can optimize and modify your code to your specifications. 
Additionally you can add one more Ultrasonic at the front of the bin, and attach servo to the lid of the bin to open and close automatically. 
Hardware Components required:
- ESP8266 NodeMCU/ Arduino Board and ESP8266 Module
- Jumper wires (M-F, F-F, M-M)
- One Ultrasonic (HC-SR04) [ two if you want to automate the Lid]
- Servo Motor (MG-996R) [optional, only to automate the lid]
- Small Dustbin
